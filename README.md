# Computer-Network-Project
# Description
This project demonstrates the application of Computer Networking Principles in building a simple website. The website was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and hosted on Netlify. This project highlights key networking principles such as DNS resolution, Git version control, and security protocols. The website is intended for educational purposes and showcases my work on various networking topics.

# Setup Process
The process involved in creating this project includes:

Building a basic website and acquiring a domain.
Setting up a GitHub repository to store and manage the project files.
Creating the website using HTML and CSS.
Deploying the website using Netlify to make it publicly accessible.
# Challenges Faced
Team Collaboration: Initially, I was working with a group but ended up completing the project on my own.
Domain and Website Setup: Finding a domain and deploying the website on Netlify was more challenging than anticipated.
Networking Principles and Protocols Applied
DNS Resolution: When a user enters the domain name, the DNS translates it into an IP address.
Netlify’s DNS ensures fast and reliable domain resolution.
Git Version Control: Changes to the website are managed using Git and pushed to GitHub, which integrates with Netlify for automated deployment.
Security Protocols: The website is protected with Netlify’s built-in DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF) to ensure security.
Tools Used
Visual Studio Code (for code editing)
Notepad (for quick edits)
HTML (for website structure)
CSS (for styling)
Netlify (for hosting and deployment)
